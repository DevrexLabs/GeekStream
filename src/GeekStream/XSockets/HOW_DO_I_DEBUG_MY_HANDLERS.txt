# HOW DO I DEBUG MY CUSTOM HANDLERS?	#
#					#
# The development server is a .exe	#
# and you cant debug loaded plugins.	#
#					#
# If you are a backend dev of XSockets	#
# and need to debug your custom handler	#
# Follow the steps below...		#
#					#
# The code for the DevelopmentServer	#
# can be found in devservercode.txt	#
#########################################

[PRE REQ: You have installed XSockets package or XSockets.DevelopmentServer package]

1: 	Create a new Console Application
	Name it whatever you like...
	But why not "HandlerDebugger"?

2:	Go to Project Properties
	(You get there by pressing "Alt + Enter" when standing on the project in solution explorer)

3:	Change target framework to:
	.NET Framework 4 (UNSELECT THE .NET Framework 4 Client Profile)

4:	Add references to:
	- XSockets.Core.dll
	- XSockets.DevelopmentServer.dll
	
	You´ll find the assemblies in the Project where XSockets (or XSockets.DevelopmentServer) package was installed:
	-> Your Project Root\XSockets\DevelopmentServer\

5:	Add an App.config

6:	Paste the content from "Your Project Root\XSockets\DevelopmentServer\XSockets.DevelopmentServer.Console.exe.config"
	into your app.config
	
7:	!IMPORTANT: Set the RefPath appsetting to the folder where your XSocketPlugins folder is.

7:	Paste this code in Program Main
	try
        {            
            new XSockets.DevelopmentServer.Start();
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            System.Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
            if (ex.InnerException != null)
                System.Console.WriteLine(ex.InnerException.Message);
            System.Console.ReadLine();
        }

8:	Compile and start, you will now be able to debug your custom handlers!

OBS!!!!!
If you want a policyserver you need to copy the crossdomain.xml to the location of the executable of your devserver.

Any issues?
